/**
 * STOP / START handling for inbound customer replies.
 *
 * Every campaign and broadcast footer promises "reply STOP to unsubscribe",
 * and the SEND side has always honoured it — WaCampaignsController and
 * BroadcastsController both drop `contacts.is_unsubscribed` rows before
 * sending. What never existed was the CAPTURE side: nothing read an inbound
 * STOP, so the flag was only ever set by hand in the contacts UI. A customer
 * could reply STOP a hundred times and still receive the next campaign.
 * (`POST /api/campaigns/unsubscribe` was built for this and documented as
 * "Node detected a STOP/UNSUB keyword" — but nothing ever called it.)
 *
 * This service closes that loop for all three engines by running from the
 * inbound paths in Laravel rather than inside the Baileys bridge, which would
 * only have covered Unofficial.
 *
 * Scope: opting out stops BULK messaging (campaigns, broadcasts, scheduled).
 * It deliberately does NOT gag a human agent replying in Team Inbox, nor
 * order/OTP messages — STOP means "stop marketing me", not "never speak to
 * me again", and silently swallowing a support reply would be worse for the
 * customer than the marketing they opted out of. This matches how Twilio and
 * Meta define STOP.
