/**
 * Mirror OUTBOUND bulk sends (broadcasts / campaigns / scheduled) into the

 * exists for that recipient in the workspace.
 *
 * Why the guard: a broadcast can hit thousands of contacts. Creating a
 * conversation row per recipient would flood the team inbox with junk. But
 * when the recipient is ALREADY an open thread (they replied earlier, an
 * agent is chatting with them), the template/broadcast we just sent them
 * should appear in that thread so the agent sees the full history instead of
 * a confusing gap (agent's reply, then the customer's answer, but the message
 * they were answering is invisible). That was the "we sent a template but it's
 * not showing in team inbox" report.
